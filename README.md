### **Key Technologies & Their Benefits:**

- **Spring Boot & Spring Cloud**: These frameworks provide a **robust and scalable** backend structure for building and deploying applications quickly. They enable **rapid development** and ensure the system is **highly scalable** to handle large volumes of claims.
  
- **Microservices**: The project utilizes a **microservices architecture**, enabling individual components to operate independently, making the system **more modular**, **flexible**, and **easier to maintain**.

- **API Gateway**: The API Gateway acts as a **single entry point** for all client requests, enabling efficient **load balancing**, **authentication**, and **routing** to the appropriate microservices.

- **Load Balancer**: This ensures **optimal distribution** of incoming requests, enhancing **system reliability** by preventing overloads on any single service.

- **Resilience4j**: With **Resilience4j**, the system is designed to **tolerate failures** by implementing circuit breakers, retries, and rate limiters, ensuring a **highly available** and **resilient** claims management process.

- **Spring Data JPA**: This simplifies database access, offering a **consistent and efficient** approach to interacting with the database, ensuring smooth **data persistence** and **retrieval** for all claim-related information.

- **Spring Security**: **Security** is a priority, with **Spring Security** safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring **robust authentication** and **authorization** mechanisms for both claimants and administrators.

- **Swagger**: Swagger provides a **clear and intuitive** interface for **API documentation**, making it easier for developers and stakeholders to interact with the systemâ€™s APIs.

- **Actuators**: Actuators provide valuable **monitoring and management** capabilities, allowing administrators to track system health, gather metrics, and gain insights into the performance of the system in real-time.

- **Eureka Server**: Eureka Server offers a **service discovery mechanism**, enabling microservices to find and communicate with each other without the need for hardcoding server addresses. This promotes **flexibility** and **dynamic scaling** in the system.
